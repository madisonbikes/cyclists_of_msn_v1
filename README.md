# Cyclists of Madison
Source code for the original Twitter bot [Cyclists of Madison](https://twitter.com/cyclists_of_msn) developed by [Madison Bikes](https://madisonbikes.org). 

## Overview
This bot posts one photo each day to a Twitter account from a pool of photographs. There are several configurable features:
* It can be run using a simple cron job and setup completely using command line tools.
* It will do its best to avoid repeating the same photo.
* It will try to pick photos from around the same time of year as the current date through the use of metadata in the images.
* It can introduce a random delay so that the post doesn't happen at the same time every day.
* It will strip out any unnecessary image metadata before it is posted, for privacy.

## Requirements
To run the bot, you should have a computer connected to the internet on regular basis, where you can schedule tasks to run periodically. On UNIX-based systems (e.g. Linux) this is called a `cron` job.

We suggest a starting pool size of around 100 photos, but that is up to you.

It is developed using the Kotlin language and running the bot tools requires that there be a recent Java runtime installed. It is developed and tested on Linux but should run on OS X and/or Windows.

It uses [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) for some of the image manipulation, so that needs to be pre-installed on whatever server is hosting the repository and running the commands.

You need to have a Twitter developer account in order to create your bot. Go to the [Twitter Developer site](https://developer.twitter.com) for more information about that.

## Build
To build, clone the repository and execute this command (if you trust our included [Gradle](https://gradle.org) wrapper):
```
# ./gradlew assemble
```
or to use your own Gradle 6.3 (or higher) installation:
```
# gradle assemble
```

## Installation
After building, the artifacts will be in `build/distributions` in `.tar.gz` and `.zip` formats (example: `cyclistsofmadisonbot-0.1-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz`). You can move these to your server and extract them to any location you like. The `bin` directory contains scripts that can be used to execute the two primary tasks.

## Usage
The bot consists of two primary commands:
1. The `register` command, which helps establish the link between this installed tool and a Twitter account of your choosing. This is done only one time at setup. You supply the Twitter Consumer API key for your bot, along with the API secret key. Then you follow on-screen instructions, and a configuration file is created that can be used for the `post` command.
2. The `post` tool, which chooses a photo from the pool, prepares a post and sends it to Twitter. Normally this is run from a cron job, once per day. Use the `--dry-run` argument for testing purposes.

To run the tasks, use the `cyclistsofmadisonbot` command line tool (exact output may not be up-to-date in the README):
```
# ./bin/cyclistsofmadisonbot --help
usage: cyclistsofmadisonbot [-h] {register,post} ...

positional arguments:
  {register,post}

named arguments:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
```
### `register` command
```
# ./bin/cyclistsofmadisonbot register --help
usage: cyclistsofmadisonbot register [-h] -c TWITTER_CONFIG consumer_api_key consumer_api_secret_key

Setup the link to your Twitter bot. Creates a JSON configuration file after complete.

positional arguments:
  consumer_api_key       Twitter Consumer API key
  consumer_api_secret_key
                         Twitter Consumer API secret key

named arguments:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
  -c TWITTER_CONFIG, --twitter-config TWITTER_CONFIG
                         Output JSON configuration file containing Twitter tokens and keys
```

The Twitter Consumer API keys are created and stored in your Twitter developer account.

### `post` command
```
# ./bin/cyclistsofmadisonbot post --help
usage: cyclistsofmadisonbot post [-h] -c TWITTER_CONFIG [--base-directory BASE_DIRECTORY] [--dry-run] [--random-delay RANDOM_DELAY]
                            [--minimum-repost-interval MINIMUM_REPOST_INTERVAL] [--seasonality-window SEASONALITY_WINDOW]

Post a new item from the bot

named arguments:
  -h, --help             show this help message and exit
  -c TWITTER_CONFIG, --twitter-config TWITTER_CONFIG
                         JSON configuration file containing Twitter tokens and keys
  --base-directory BASE_DIRECTORY
                         Base directory for photos and posts database. Defaults to cwd.
  --dry-run              Dry run, doesn't change anything in posts database or post anything to twitter. (default: false)
  --random-delay RANDOM_DELAY
                         Apply a random delay between zero and the supplied value in seconds before posting occurs (default: 0)
  --minimum-repost-interval MINIMUM_REPOST_INTERVAL
                         Target minimum interval (in days) before a photo will be reposted (default: 180)
  --seasonality-window SEASONALITY_WINDOW
                         Size of window (in days on either side of current date)  that  we  will search for photos that are in-season
                         (default: 45)
```
